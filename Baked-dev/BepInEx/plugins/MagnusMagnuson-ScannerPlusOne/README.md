# Scanner+1

This mod adds a customizable feature to the Radar Scanner.

After the recent update (especially), a lot of things pop up on the Radar Scanner. This mod helps realizing whether you already grabbed all possible items/equipment you want without having to hunt every question mark down.

Make sure to change the config file to your liking.

## What does it do?

With this mod you can replace the question marks with ping icons and get a notification in the chat about remaining interactables, while being very customizable.

## Features
- Replace question marks with ping icons
	- Select which interactables you want to show up and which to hide
	- Customize the icon color for each and transparency
	- Hidden interactables can still be shown as question marks if selected
- Notification about remaining interactables in chat
	- Select which interactables you want to be notified about
	- Color is the one specified for the icons
	- Legacy Mode which enables chat notifications from v1.1.1 and older
- Both of these can be turned on individually
- Client-sided. You pick your own preferences. It doesn't matter what the host uses or if he doesn't have the mod.
