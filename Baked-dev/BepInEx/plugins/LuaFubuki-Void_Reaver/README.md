[Major Update as of 04/07/2020!]

Information:
Adds in a playable Void Reaver into Risk of Rain 2. 
 - Primary and Secondary skills act as if you have 0.5 of the Lunar item equivalents.
 - Secondary is derived from the the Void Reaver's only original attack. It's been modified to activate where you're looking, and has been given a shorter timer on explosions.
 - Special sacrifices half your health to deal a big burst of damage.

Multiplayer:
All players need the mod installed!

-----

Known Bugs:
 - Getting frozen makes Void Reaver's feet fly up. This is a vanilla bug as far as I'm aware.

(Please let me know if you find anything else!)

-----

Ver 0.0.1
 - First Release

Ver 0.0.2
 - Secondary now will summon bombs at the spot you're looking instead of in an area in front of you. With the added control, bomb number has been reduced and the area has been shrunk down.
 - Utility should now make you impossible to hit even when you're not the host
 - Scaled up Void Reaver's size a bit, let me know if this causes any issues but I didn't run into any while playtesting!
 - Reave now will leave you at 1HP rather than killing you when below 50% health
 - Added more detailed (and and colorful!) stats about each skill
 - Added a display model to the selection screen
 - General bug and stat fixes

Ver 0.1.0/0.1.1
 - Updated for the Artifacts update!
 - Added skill icons.
 - Removed debug messages (oops!).

Ver 0.2.0
 - Major quality update
 - Reticle changed so that there's a dot in the center (Helpful for pinging)
 - Secondary now has Proc Coefficient! Apparently proc coefficient is still broken for enemy Reavers...
 - Utility has been completely redone. Now is 100% identical to the item and works on clients!
 - Special got a bit wonkey with the latest update so I went over it and found I did a lot of things wrong, so I worked on effects and networking and fixed the health values so it should now function as intended!
 - Alt Special (Client Reave) is GONE!! Now Reave works on both host and client!!
 - I learned quite a bit since I last worked on Void Reaver and I made plenty of mistakes back then, so I took some time to really fix it up and give it some polish...!
