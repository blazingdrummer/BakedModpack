This mod allows you configure the proc coefficient and critical strike chance for Acrid's Poison.

The proc coefficient is defaulted to 1 and uses base game proc coefficient scaling.

The critical strike chance coefficient is defaulted to 1, this coefficient simply multiplies Acrid's crit chance (after items). 
Set this to 0.5 to halve the crit chance, 1 for default, 2 for double etc.

Note that in order to use this mod in multiplayer, everyone must have this mod installed.
