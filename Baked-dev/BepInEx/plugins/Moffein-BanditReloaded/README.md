## BanditReloaded
- The most comprehensive Bandit rework yet. Highly configurable!
	- Bandit's Blast skill allows him to shoot faster if you click faster, but the mod is balanced around the autofire fire rate. Mashing to click faster was enabled due to popular demand.

## IMPORTANT: READ THIS
- The host must have the mod installed for it to work.
- The first option in the config is "Enable Body Clones" which is disabled by default. Enabling this will improve compatibility with other Bandit mods, BUT will break compatibility with unmodded players and any BanditReloaded user who doesn't have it enabled. Leave this setting disabled unless you plan to ensure that every player will have it enabled.
- The Crowdfunder doesn't work on Bandit currently.
- Bandit currently does not support the Artifact of Vengeance
