# MacroCommands

Assign keybinds and chain console commands together to give easy access to frequently used commands.

## This mod has dependencies

This will not work without the dependencies! Make sure you get them.

## Creating a macro

Press F1 (default) to open the Bepinex Configuration Manager and open the settings for this mod. You will see large areas in which you can input your macro commands.

In the large black box type your commands just as you would in the console. If you want to do multiplecommands they are seperated by `;`.

E.g. `give_item hoof 16; give_item feather 200; god`

If you want your command to run more than once then tick the box next to "Repeat". Type in the number to the right of how many times you wish your above macro string to run. 

E.g. type 5 into this box to run `give_item hoof 16; give_item feather 200; god` five times.

Finally, you set the keyboard shortcut in the third option. To set or change the keyboard shortcut first press "Edit". The UI will then prompt for you to type any number of keys. Type the keys you wish your shortcut to be (with the Main Key being the last one you press) then press "Ok" to finish edditing or "Cancel" to cancel.

E.g. if you want your macro to be assigned to "Ctrl + C" 1) click edit, 2) press Ctrl, 3) press C, 4) click ok

## Advanced

Currently to keep things simple I have set this to a limited number of macroes. By default you have 5 macro configurations and 5 more hidden in advanced settings.

There are currently no plans to expand on this.

If you have any issues you can usually find me on the ROR2 modding discord (@Fluffatron). Please bear in mind that as with all mods here this is something I do in my spare time so may not always be able to immediately fix any issues that you come up with.
