## What is Ordered Items
Ordered Items is a completely clientside quality of life mod. It organizes the items in the item bar by their in game ID and their Tier. This removes the cluttered and unintuitive system implemented by the game, where the items are placed in the order that they are aqcuired. The Tier ordering can be modified in the configuration file. In addition, the mod does not affect anyone without it installed and does not require you to be host or any other players to have the mod installed for it to work.
