# Properly Persistent Profiles Patch Plugin

> Locks-in your modded Eclipse levels, loadouts, and logbook entries to live through any lapses in their linked mod.

## What does this mod do?
Usually, when you launch the game without a mod all the stats, log unlocks, survivor skill preferences, etc. associated with that mod are lost. This mod saves those stats in profile purgatory so you can shuffle around your other mods as much as you want.
</br></br>Each saved item is configurable:
* Stats
* Unlockables (such as monster and stage logs)
* Survivor loadouts
* Discovered items and equipment

**This mod also permanently stores Eclipse levels so you can progress Eclipse on modded survivors.**

## What happens if I stop using this mod?
* Stats, loadouts, and discovered pickups that were being saved by this mod will be lost
* Eclipse levels on modded survivors are NOT lost, but you may need this mod to access them

## Disclaimer
This mod interfaces with your user profiles and there is always a small chance of data loss or profile corruption, especially in the case of a mod conflict or game update. If you're worried about your progress being lost or hindered, you can always store a profile backup.
