Makes Grovetender Wisps unkillable so that melee characters can't completely negate them by simply standing in front of them and holding m1, and also because being able to trigger on-kills off of them makes the Grovetender's cool signature straight up turn into a liability for itself.

Config allows for alternate mode where the Wisps are killable but don't trigger on-kills.

## Installation
