Lets you blacklist items from Monsters, Vengeance Doppelgangers, Scavengers, and Mithrix.

Vanilla blacklists can be disabled in the config.
Unstable Tesla Coil, N'kuhana's Opinion, and Razor Wire are blacklisted by default in the config.

Default Blacklist:

- Frost Relic
- Unstable Tesla Coil
- N'kuhana's Opinion
- Razor Wire
- Regenerating Scrap
- Shipping Request Form
- Spare Drone Parts
- Ben's Raincoat
- Shuriken

To blacklist items, enter the internal item names separated by commas into the config.

You can view a list of item/equipment codenames using the list_item/list_equipment command from [DebugToolKit](https://thunderstore.io/package/IHarbHD/DebugToolkit/).

Server-Side and Vanilla-Compatible, only the host needs the mod.

	- Blacklisting items completely removes them from their inventory, so they won't be able to drop blacklisted items.

`1.1.0`

- Added support for blacklisting equipments. (Code based on Unordinal's AI Blacklister https://github.com/Unordinal/UnosRoR2Mods/tree/master/AIBlacklister)
	- It's possible to blacklist Elite affixes, but this may be buggy.
		- It will attempt to reroll an elite affix that isn't Perfected/Malachite/Celestine.
		- The elite's stat boosts may be different from what's intended (ex. banning Malachites will reroll the elite, but it will keep its original Malachite stat boost).

`1.0.1`

- Accidentally a word in the manifest description.

`1.0.0`

- Release
