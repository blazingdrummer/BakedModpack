## Mod Overview
BalanceOverhaulRBO is a BALANCE MOD whose primary intent is to shift the balance and meta of Risk of Rain 2, away from excessive healing and mobility, and more towards "Effective Health" options like shield and armor. Additionally, many items have been adjusted (mostly with proc coefficient on Damaging On-Kill Effects), in hopes that it will greatly increase player involvement in longer runs where the game would otherwise be "automatically played" by their item setup.

In vanilla RoR2, the balance is often in a state such that taking a hit can mean either death happens in an instant, or else it is very easy to recover from it due to the high availability of healing. With the changes to the state of RoR2's balance, it is moreso punishing in the sense that recovery from taking a hit can be difficult and will often lead to death if you are not careful. Aggressive play is encouraged and supported through new defensive items and avenues. This means gameplay is generally more fair, but unforgiving.

Due to the nature of balancing for longer runs, this is a mod that is very difficult to playtest and balance for, so all feedback is greatly appreciated. Once again, if you have anything to say, then please join the discord server.
