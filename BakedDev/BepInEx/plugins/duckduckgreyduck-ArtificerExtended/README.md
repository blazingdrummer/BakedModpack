## Mod Overview
ArtificerExtended introduces a handful of new skills for Artificer with the intention of adding new, varied gameplay styles in creative ways. This is built with compatability for AlternativeArtificer as a primary goal. Currently introduces 3 new abilities: SNOWBALLS, ICE SHARDS, and NAPALM BARRAGE!

## New Primary: "Snowballs"
Snowballs are an ICE m1 that, unlike her other bolts, are un-limited by cooldown. This means they can scale perfectly with attack speed - a great asset for lategame and ion surge users!

### Stats:
- Fires once every 0.6 seconds 
- 180% damage per hit
- 0.7 proc coefficient
- 50% slow on hit
- This skill DOES contribute to the "ice" part of AlternativeArtificer's passive, however it's unable to freeze + execute enemies on it's own, so you will need to pick another ice skill to benefit from the ice passive. I am considering adding an additional way for this ability to scale with the passive, at least until Rein updates AlternateArtificer to accomodate for it.

## New Primary: "Ice Shards" (icon coming soon)
Ice Shards are another ICE m1 with a low range shotgun-like fire. This skill is designed for high risk, high reward play - it synergizes great with her other low range skills, like flamethrower, and the new Napalm!

### Stats:
- Fires once every 0.3 seconds (like her other bolts)
- 1.25s cooldown, 4 charges max (like her other bolts)
- 3x140% damage per hit (420% total)
- 0.6 proc coefficient
- 25m max range (same max range as Flamethrower)
- 50% slow on hit
- This skill DOES contribute to the "ice" part of AlternativeArtificer's passive, however it's unable to freeze + execute enemies on it's own, so you will need to pick another ice skill to benefit from the ice passive.

## New Utility: "Napalm Barrage" (icon coming soon)
Napalm Barrage is a FIRE alternative to snapfreeze, with the aim to create a more offensive option as opposed to defensive. It sprays a cone of napalm puddles extending outwards from the player, with the ability to CHARGE IT UP (much like the charging of Nanobombs and Nanospears) to tune the spread. Much like the new Ice Shards, Napalm is intended to reward risky play styles, as well as synergizing with the outward piercing attacks of Flamethrower and Nanospears! Like Snapfreeze, it can be used either as a tool to maximize damage output, or for area denial.

### Stats:
- Charge time of 0.5 to 3.0 seconds
- 8 second cooldown (Napalm stays on the ground for 8 seconds)
- 200% to 400% damage on hit, depending on charge
- 0.6 proc coefficient on impact
- The Napalm itself burns with identical stats to Artificer's "Ignite" debuffs, and also scales damage per tick with the "fire" part AlternateArtificer's passive.

## Changelog
### 1.1.1
- Reduced Napalm projectile count from 15 to 12
- Increase Napalm AOE/decal size from 2 to 3
(* Napalm originally had a LOT of projectiles firing at once to make up for a small AOE size, to help cover large areas at a decent range, but as I learned to tune more numbers that became less necessary. These changes effectively keep the napalm's effectiveness at mid-long ranges the same or even better, while nerfing the insane burn damage that could be stacked in a single spot should you fire it at point-blank)
- Reduced Napalm's "dot" proc coefficient to 0
- Increased Napalm's impact proc coefficient from 0.5 to 0.6
- Updated Napalm's description to reflect proc coefficient on Thunderstore
### 1.1.0
- Reduced snowball attack duration to 0.6
- Added clarification to the effects of snowballs on the AlternateArtificer passive
- Updated mod thumbnail + description
- Added 2 new skills: NAPALM BARRAGE and ICE SHARDS
- Removed CLAPFREEZE (Rest In Peace, You Will Remain Forever In Our Hearts)
### 1.0.0
- First release: Introduced SNOWBALLS and CLAPFREEZE
