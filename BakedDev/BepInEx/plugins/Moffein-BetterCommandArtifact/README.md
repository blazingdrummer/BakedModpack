Original mod from https://thunderstore.io/package/Boooooop/BetterCommandArtifact/

Restricts Command options to 3 (configurable), and makes it so that boss item selection is restricted to 1.

Updating this because all the other Command/Potential plugins have issues:

- ArtifactOfPotential adds/removes hooks constantly and causes serious stutters.

- CommandPotential does not work with YEET.

- ImprovedCommandEssence does not remember the original item drop, and will cause the Relic of Energy from ForgottenRelics to drop random boss items.
