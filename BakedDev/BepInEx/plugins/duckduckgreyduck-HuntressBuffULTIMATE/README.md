# Overview:
HuntressBuffULTIMATE buffs the criminally underpowered Huntress... by nerfing sprint on ALL non-Agile skills! This change was exclusively inspired by Hopoo's ORIGINAL vision of sprint as a mechanic when they added it in to RoR2.

These nerfs to sprinting also come with significant buffs to Energy Drink!

But, if nerfing sprint on all non-Agile skills is not your speed, you can also opt to make all skills Agile instead! Everyone wins, except for JohnEdwa! RTAutoSprint is now out of style...

## What does HuntressBuffULTIMATE actually do?

In Vanilla ROR2, non-Agile skills force you to stop sprinting at the start of the attack. However, you are still able to sprint during ALL skills (except ones that are canceled by sprinting), as long as you start sprinting during the attack. This isn't noticeable for many short skills, but it means the optimal way of play is essentially to mash the sprint key to get as much speed as possible. 

To address this, HuntressBuffULTIMATE has two solutions, Sprint Nerf and Sprint Buff:
- Sprint Nerf makes it so that sprinting is CONTINUOUSLY disabled during non-Agile skills. This makes way for sprinting to be more powerful for it's intended use: long distance movement out of combat. On top of this, the buff to Energy Drink is fully configurable!
- Sprint Buff removes the anti-sprint behavior entirely, so that you never need to bother with skills canceling sprint again. The only exception with Sprint Buff is that it doesnt touch skills which are canceled by sprinting, like Flamethrower and Snapfreeze.

## Why?

These changes are meant to pave the way for a more intuitive RoR2 experience both ways. With Sprint Nerf, sprinting as a mechanic holds a more grounded purpose in RoR2. With Sprint Buff, sprinting for mobility is less intrusive than it would be otherwise.
