# Fade Empty Chests

This mod will make empty chests and barrels gradually fade out after they are opened, becoming darker and partially transparent.

This mod is intended to be an alternative to [EmptyChestsBeGone](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheRealElysium/EmptyChestsBeGone/), which simply deletes opened containers. I made this because I wanted to be able to still see where containers have been. If you don't care about that, consider using EmptyChestsBeGone insteadâ€”it's simpler and probably less prone to weird stuff happening :p

Tested and works in multiplayer! (Well, mostly; see [Known Issues](https://github.com/SuperSupermario24/FadeEmptyChests/blob/master/README.md#known-issues) on GitHub.)

If you have any issues or suggestions, ping me on Discord (SSM24#0079) or open an issue on GitHub. Pinging me on Discord is preferred, since I check that much more often than GitHub.

## Config options

* **Brightness Multiplier**: How much containers should be darkened.
* **Fade Out Time**: How long containers should take to fade out.
