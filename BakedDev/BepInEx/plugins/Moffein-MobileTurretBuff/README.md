## MobileTurretBuff
Gives Engi's Mobile Turrets extra survivability.
- Mobile Turrets now have AOE resistance like drones, since they don't seek cover from Vagrants and won't stay inside of an Engi shield.
- HP Regen values have been increased from 0.6/0.12 to 2.5/0.5.
- Base armor increased to 20.
