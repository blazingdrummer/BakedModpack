# '1.6.2' - Whoops

## Runtime

* Removed "Error On Obsolete" setting for MSDirectorCardCategorySeleection and MSDCCSPool

## Editor

* Fixed Inspectors still showing the deprecated fields instead of the new ones

# '1.6.1' - Dependency changes and Rectifications

* Added Onboarding and Documentation to begin developping a PR for MSU, Thanks Buns!

## Runtime:

* Now Dependant on ``R2API_Addressables``
* Deprecated the following classes:
    * ``AddressableAsset``
    * ``AddressableBuffDef``
    * ``AddressableEliteDef``
    * ``AddressableEquipmentDef``
    * ``AddressableExpansionDef``
    * ``AddressableGameObject``
    * ``AddressableItemDef``
    * ``AddressableSpawnCard``
    * ``AddressableUnlockableDef``
        * These have been replaced by the AddressReferencedAsset system from ``R2API_Addressables``
        * Any ScriptableObject affected by these changes now have a ContextMenu for upgrading to their new versions.
    * ``MSDCCSPool``
    * ``MSDirectorCardCategorySelection``
        * These have been replaced by the ``AddressableDCCSPool`` and ``AddressableDirectorCardCategorySelection`` from ``R2API_Director``
* ``InteractableBase`` and ``MonsterBase`` can now specify multiple Cards.
* ``InteractableBase`` and ``MonsterBase`` can now implement custom IsAvailable methods, which will determine if the Monster or Interactable will be added to the stage
* Added ``IEqualityComparers`` for ``MSMonsterDirectorCard`` and ``MSInteractableDirectorCard``, used for comparing equality between card prefabs.
* ``AddressableInjector`` now only shows fields which are of type ``UnityEngine.Object``, largely cutting the amount of invalid options
* Fixed issues where ``AddressableInjector``, ``CameraInstantiator``, ``InstantiateAddressablePrefab`` and ``SurfaceDefInjector`` would cause invalid GUIDs on scenes
* Attempted to fix an issue where MSU would create multiple reflection type objects during dependent mod initializations
* Fixed issue where the EventDirector would sometimes fail to find the required state machine

## Debug Build Exclusive

    * Based off the ``MSULog`` class
    * Uses the ``BepInEx`` ``ManualLogSource``
    * Contains static methods for logging level ``Info``, ``Message``, ``Debug``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``
    * On the ``UnityEditor``, these static methods use the ``UnityEngine.Debug`` class' methods to avoid exceptions

    * A ``DelegateContainer`` stores these invoked methods, can be used to manually raise said methods.
* Deprecated ``ConfigurableString MakeConfigurableInt(string, Action<ConfigurableString>)`` as it was wrongly named.
    * Added a new method with the correct name to rectify this
* Fixed an issue where ``MSInteractableDirectorCard`` and ``MSMonsterDirectorCard`` couldn't specify the custom category's Weights. 

## Debug Build Exclusive:
* Removed the Material Tester. We recommend you use [this](https://thunderstore.io/package/Groove_Salad/RuntimeMaterialInspector/1.0.0/) instead
* ``LogLoader`` has a property to specify what level of severity of Debug.Log can cause a ``Debugger`` to ``Break``.
* Debugging related config entries for MSU are now stored on a separate ``ConfigFile``. The ``ConfigEntries`` in this ``ConfigFile`` also appears as a separate entry on RiskOfOptions's ModSettings window

## Runtime:
* Constructor for ConfigurableVariable no longer attempts to set the ``ModGUID`` and ``ModName`` to the Calling Assembly's ``BaseUnityPlugin``
* Added Factory methods to ``ConfigLoader<T>`` to create ConfigurableVariables and their built in inheriting classes.
    * Factory methods require an instance of your ConfigLoader to work
    * Factory methods automatically set the ConfigurableVariable's ``ModGUID`` and ``ModName``
    * Factory methods contain an optional ``Action<ConfigurableVariableType>`` to initialize the configurable variable, as a near identical implementation of initializing them using the ``ObjectInitializer`` pattern

# '1.5.2' - ConfigurableVariable improvements

## Runtime:

    * Works as fields and properties.
    * a ``ConfigFile`` can be assigned directly or via the identifier system of the ``ConfigSystem``
    * Just like ``ConfigurableFieldAttribute``, if a ``Section`` and ``Key`` are not specified, it uses a nicified string of the ``DeclaringType`` and ``MemberInfo`` names
    * ConfigurableVariables can be created with method chaining or Object Initialization
    * ConfigurableVariables can be bound immediatly, or bound automatically when RoR2 loads
    * Doesnt support Risk of Options by itself
* Added the following classes that inherit from ``ConfigurableVariable``:
    1. ``ConfigurableBool``
    2. ``ConfigurableColor``
    3. ``ConfigurableEnum<TEnum>``
    4. ``ConfigurableFloat``
    5. ``ConfigurableInt``

    * This is done via collecting all the IDRS in the game and assigning string keys, alongside collecting all the display prefabs, and assigning string keys that correspond to their key asset
    * In ``DEBUG`` mode, the ItemDisplayCatalog serializes all the data collected into an ``ItemDisplayCatalog.json``
    * The ``ItemDisplayCatalog.json`` is then used in the Editor for adding data and manipulating existing ``ItemDisplayDictionary`` and ``NamedIDRS`` assets

# '0.5.0'

~~* Additions:
    * Added Event system API (*Look, I normally don't do this, okay? I don't really know what else has been done , but this is Starstorm 2's Event API, forcefully ripped out and put in a place where YOU can use it. There is NO documentation. I don't even know if it works. But you can (probably) use it to do cool stuff!
     ...I hope Nebby forgives me for this one.)~~

No, I do not.

Actual changelog:

* Additions:
    * Added the ability to extend from the MoonstormItemManager component.
        * Extending from the manager requires you to extend from the "ManagerExtension" component.
        * Immediate References to the characterBody attatched to the manager extension, the manager itself as well.
        * Virtual methods for GetInterfaces, CheckForItems and CheckForBuffs.
    * Added the EventAPI from Starstorm2Nightly into MSU.
        * The Event API itself is not documented and very much WIP.
        * EventAPI should have everything to add custom events.
        * EventAPI works via a custom director, events themselves are simply entity states.
        * All Events should inherit from the GenericEvent entitystate, which is found in the EntityStates.Events namespace.
* Changes
    * Artifact Content Base:
        * Added OnArtifactEnabled() and OnArtifactDisabled() abstract methods, subscribe and unsuscribe from hooks in these methods. System closely resembles how the Artifact Managers of RoR2 Work.
        * Added an Abstract field for an ArtifactCode from R2API's ArtifactCodeAPI, can be left null.
    * Artifact Module Base:
        * Added some actual hooks onto the RunArtifactManager.
    * Pickups Module Base: Added an Event when the ItemManager is added.
    * Material Tester:
        * Can no longer be spawned outside of runs
        * Renderer is no longer null by default
        * Can now be destroyed easily by enabling the "DestroyOnEnable" component.

# '0.4.1'

* Additions:
    * Added the StageModuleBase & StageBase
        * Used for handling custom stages
        * Compatible with ROS
* Changes:
    * Marked the MSAspectAbilityDataHolder as Deprecated, will be removed on the next major update.
    * Now Dependant on [Microsoft CSharp](https://thunderstore.io/package/RiskofThunder/Microsoft_CSharp/)
    * Changed how Elite Equipments get initialized
        * This Retroactively fixes an issue where, if the Elite Equipment Base overrides the AddItemBehavior method, but its not fully initialized (like disabling it from a config) it would add the item behavior regardless ((Example on the issue)[https://github.com/swuff-star/LostInTransit/issues/2])
    * Completely Revamped the Dynamic Description attribute.
        * Now called the "TokenModifier" attribute.
        * Used on Fields that are public & static
        * Requires the following arguments
            * String: the Token to modify
            * StatType: Used for modifying the value held in the field
                * Default: No changes are made
                * Percentage: The value on the field is multiplied by 100
                * DivideBy2: The value on the field is divided by 2
                * If you need a specific stat type, ask it in the starstorm discord and we might add it.
            * FormatIndex: the index used for formatting.
        * Should technically work with any mod.
        * Not usable on mods that load their language via LanguageAPI (Due to languageAPI's string by tokens dictionaries being private.)
* Bug Fixes: 
    * Fixed an issue where moonstorm dependant mods would try to access MSUtil on the Moonstorm.Utilities namespace despite being on the Moonstorm namespace 

# '0.4.0'

* Added ConfigurableField attribute
    * Used for automatically creating config options for fields.
* Added DynamicDescription attribute
    * Used for dynamically modifying the description of an item via the use of formatting, and provided fields.


# '0.3.0'

* Rewrote a lot of the Elite related code to allow for more pleasant and balanced behaviors.
    * Fixed Elite Ramps not Reseting properly when grabbing an MSEliteEquipment and then grabbing a vanilla one.
    * Added Tooltips for the MSEliteDef
* Added an Opaque Cloud Remap runtime editor. (OCR are deprecated, ghor recommends using regular cloud remaps instead).
* Projectiles with CharacterBody components now get added to the Serializable Content Pack's CharacterBody prefabs.
* Added IOnIncomingDamageOtherServerReceiver
    * Used to modify the incoming damage of soon to be Victims in the damage report, it is similar to the IOnIncomingDamage interface.
* Almost all classes are now documented, However, MSU does not come with XML documentation yet.
* Made MoonstormEditorUtils Dependant on MoonstormSharedUtils.
* Changes to the IDRS System.
    * The ItemDisplayPrefab scriptable object has been revamped to a key asset display pair holder.
