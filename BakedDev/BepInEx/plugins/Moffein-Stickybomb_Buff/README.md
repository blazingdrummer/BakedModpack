Increases Stickybomb damage from 180% to 250%, removes blast falloff, and reduces the fuse from 1.5s to 1s.
For reference, this boosts the damage bonus from Stickybombs from 9% (5% chance of 180% damage) to 12.5% (5% chance of 250% damage).
This damage is higher than Glasses but lower than Syringes, but unlike Glasses/Syringes, Stickybombs have no notable item synergies to speak of, and they don't affect your entire damage output like crits do.
The blast falloff removal and fuse reduction is due to how inconsistent Stickies are online, often falling off of targets and doing nothing.

Server-side and vanilla-compatible.
