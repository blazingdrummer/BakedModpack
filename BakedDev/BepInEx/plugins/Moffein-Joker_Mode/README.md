## Joker Mode

- Notes:
	- Joker Mode removes the +100 armor from Corruption before applying the armor penalty, giving you a total of -25 Armor
	- Joker Mode prevents your Uncorrupted skills from being refreshed when leaving Corruption.
	
Mostly untested.
	
## Compatibility

- Compatible with RiskyMod
- Probably will have compatibility issues with other Void Fiend skill mods.
- Skill damage penalty only applies to Vanilla Corrupted skills. Modded corrupted skills won't have the penalty unless they specifically code it.

## Changelog

	- Scepter now matches by SkillDef instead of Index for better mod compatibility.

	- Scepter Skill: 【PS?YKO J??oker ?M?ode』
		- Removes Corrupt damage penalty.

	- Changed -25 Armor to +25% damage taken.
		- Roughly the same survivability decrease, but prevents the penalty from simply being negated by a few armor items.
		
	- Fixed Joker Mode removing an additional 100 armor when RiskyMod is installed (and not removing the armor if RiskyMod isn't installed).
