Each item has a unique effect and configurable values. Special thanks to the RoR2 Modding Discord for teaching me how to do this, and for providing enough feedback on the mod to get it to this point.

# Bugs

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Overkill Overdrive's incompatibility with certain mods. I'd prefer a way to have it modify Focus Crystal and Bustling Fungus non-destructively.
* Corrupting Parasite can be found without the achievement. Not sure why this is happening.

Please give feedback/bug reports on the RoR2 Modding discord, or by messaging directly: hex3#7952

# Changelog

### 2.1.0 - For balance changes to take effect, delete your config file. This will be done automatically in the future.
A 3.0 update is in the future with new items, but first I want to focus on getting everything in working condition, and making it all look good.
* **Revamped VFX** for Apathy
* **Captain's Favor Rework:** The first chests you open each stage will instead contain a Void Potential.
* **Discovery Rework:** Using a world interactable grants a small amount of permanent regenerating shield to your whole team.
* 400 Tickets now works on lockboxes, void potentials and (optionally) cleansing pools. Thanks to prodzpod for contributing this fix.
* Scattered Reflection no longer procs off of itself or razorwire.
* Scattered Reflection damage prevention cap reduced to 80%.
* Empathy healing now stacks.
* Do Not Eat is rewritten so that it is tracked per-player, using each player's luck value individually.
* Do Not Eat can now work on multishop terminals.
* Do Not Eat is now AI blacklisted.
* Do Not Eat item displays corrected.
* Corrupting Parasite can now be configured to not corrupt in hidden realms and the bazaar.
* One Ticket should no longer spawn the Artifact Reliquary as an elite.
* Added support for Ghostly Apple (Mystic's Items) to Scavenger's Pouch.
* <details><summary>Bucket List non-boss speed boost 20% -> 24%</summary>Bucket List, come to think of it, doesn't have enough of an edge over other movement speed items to justify its downside. This buff makes it considerably better than a Goat Hoof, increasing its case for use.</details>
* <details><summary>Bucket List speed reduction if boss present 75% -> 80%</summary>Slight increase in downside to make up for the buff. It should still provide around 5% speed while a boss exists.</details>
* <details><summary>Hopoo Egg jump height boost 20% -> 30%</summary>Sometimes you just want to jump higher.</details>
* <details><summary>Empathy effective range 20m -> 13m</summary>Both of these items felt like they overreached their niche as melee boosters. It also puts it in line with Focus Crystal, increasing their opportunity to work together.</details>
* <details><summary>Scavenger's Pouch disabled by default for items: Delicate Watch, Regenerating Scrap, One Ticket, Platinum Card (Mystic's), Clockwork Mechanism (VanillaVoid), Sharpened Chopsticks (HCFIB)</summary>There were a few unsatisfying interactions with the pouch that either instantly consumed it or consumed it for very little gain. Regenerating Scrap and Platinum Card regen every stage- making the replacement redundant- and the watch items can easily consume all charges of a pack if you fall to low HP. One Ticket being replaced gives very little value, as you almost always want to just be rid of it when given the chance. You can always re-enable these if you want.</details>
* <details><summary>The Unforgivable activation interval 8s -> 10s</summary>Turns out, an on-kill effect at your location every 8 seconds is very powerful. It also stacks extremely well. I'm unsure if this is enough of a nerf, but it should hamper the item's power a bit.</details>
* <details><summary>Apathy effective range 20m -> 13m</summary>Both of these items felt like they overreached their niche as melee boosters. It also puts it in line with Focus Crystal, increasing their opportunity to work together.</details>
* <details><summary>Apathy stacks required for buff 15 -> 10</summary>To compensate for the range nerf.</details>
* <details><summary>Apathy buff duration 5s -> 7.5s</summary>Apathy already lacked consistency and felt a little underwhelming, so I gave it a bit of a duration boost.</details>
* <details><summary>Elder Mutagen 1 HP/s regen per species -> 0.5 HP/s</summary>Elder mutagen can stack very quickly up to 20 or even 30, making its regen extremely powerful for a single item. It feels justified to just halve it.</details>
* <details><summary>Elder Mutagen 15 max HP per species -> 10 max HP</summary>If we're still going on 30 being a benchmark, having 300 extra HP from one item is pretty potent, especially combined with the added regen.</details>
* <details><summary>Mint Condition first stack jump increase 0 -> 1</summary>A very powerful item still; I just felt like there should be more accessible ways to gain extra jumps.</details>
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Changed some RiskOfOptions sliders to be easier to use.
* RiskOfOptions sliders now generate automatically. <sup>Looking at you, HIFU</sup>

### 2.0.7
* Disabling items via config now actually disables them on the next run, removing them from the drop pool.
* Discovery's hidden item will no longer spam the logs
* Fixed some mixed-up configuration
* Fixed some readme details

### 2.0.6 - For best results, delete your config file before startup.
**Risk Of Options integration!** All configurable settings can now be changed in real time through the Mod Settings menu. Visual changes to stats will update between stages.
* Added a toggleable expansion to the lobby menu.
* <details><summary>Elder Mutagen max health boost per species 4% Max HP -> 15 Max HP</summary>Elder Mutagen's max health stacking was a little too potent for one legendary item, considering how many species can be killed in one run. The flat HP boost should still net you 300 max HP for killing 20 unique species, which is a decent number.</details>
* <details><summary>Mint Condition default move speed per additional stack 40% -> 60%</summary>The stacking should be more powerful for this item since above 1 stack it doesn't give any new effects, just mobility.</details>
* <details><summary>Captain's Favor default interactable increase 10% -> 7.5%</summary>This item's increase in interactables boosts the most powerful thing in the game: Items. A nerf is necessary to make this an actual tradeoff with tickets.</details>
* Scavenger's Pack's synergy with Regenerating Scrap can now be disabled properly
* Mint Condition should remove debuffs more reliably
* Fixed the dependencies

### 2.0.5
I am currently in the process of re-modelling each of this mod's items, because some of them were rushed and I'd like for the mod to have a more complete visual style. These changes will come out gradually along with some fixes once I have time to investigate the more annoying bugs.
* **Revamped VFX** for Empathy
* **Revamped VFX** for Scavenger's Pack: Now named Scavenger's Pouch
* **Revamped VFX** for Elder Mutagen
* Updated to latest R2API version.
* Overkill Overdrive's Bustling Fungus and Focus Crystal buffs are now automatically disabled while UltimateCustomRun or VanillaRebalance are present, to avoid conflicts.
* Fixed One Ticket spamming the logs (I think)

### 2.0.4
* <details><summary>Apathy default regen boost 15 hp/s -> 20 hp/s</summary>Apathy's regen only occurs for 5 seconds at a time, so its effects shouldn't feel underwhelming. Might change more if necessary.</details>
* Overkill Overdrive now affects Void Fields cells
* Empathy and Apathy now properly utilize Overkill Overdrive's configurable radius boost
* Empathy now actually uses the config value for healing instead of 2
* Small VFX improvements to Overkill Overdrive, Empathy, Apathy, Drop Of Necrosis and Spattered Collection
* ATG Prototype optimizations
* Fixed some readme details

### 2.0.3
* <details><summary>Scattered Reflection default reflect damage boost per stack 70% -> 700%</summary>Scattered Reflection can be a potent item when it comes to damage prevention if you get the right build going, but its damage was always very underwhelming for a green item. This 10x increase seems huge but it really just bumps it up to usable levels, considering how low 7% really is.</details>
* <details><summary>Empathy default healing per hit 2 -> 4</summary>For its limitations, it really should have a bit more healing power than two leeching seeds.</details>
* <details><summary>Scavenger's Pack default uses 3 -> 2</summary>Scavenger's Pack is hard to balance because some consumable items are incredibly good, while others aren't. Having less uses might make one value their pack more, and consider which consumables they want to pick up.</details>
* <details><summary>Do Not Eat default pearl chance 8% -> 10%</summary>A little boost for this item, because it kind of needs it.</details>
* <details><summary>One Ticket now provides immunity to the Cripple debuff while it's being held.</summary>Fighting Perfected Elites is a challenge on its own with their shields and extra stats, but on top of that, the cripple debuff made it way more tedious than challenging. It also gives you a much needed "advantage" if you're forced to keep the item for difficult fights.</details>
* Overkill Overdrive now has an optional blacklist for Engineer turrets.
* One Ticket now has a proper consumed version.
* Fixed a conflict with ArtifactOfPotential and Do Not Eat.

### 2.0.2
* Overkill Overdrive no longer prevents bustling fungus from stacking. **However, be careful about using mods that change the radius of Bustling Fungus or Focus Crystal, as they'll most likely break this item and cause errors. I may add special support for mods like this in the future.**
* To compensate, the zones that Overkill Overdrive affects can now be enabled or disabled individually.
* 400 Tickets description clarified.

### 2.0.1

* Fixed an issue where some enemies were untargetable by Huntress

### 1.1.0 - Due to the many changes, deleting or modifying your config file will be necessary.
