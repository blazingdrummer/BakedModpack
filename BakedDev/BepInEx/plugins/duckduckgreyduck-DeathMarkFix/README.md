## Mod Overview
DeathMarkFix allows Death Mark to finally deal more than just 50% extra damage regardless of item stack, by allowing the buff to stack on application, which was what it meant to do in the first place.

### Changes
DeathMark BuffDef "canStack" changed from false to true. No other functionality modified. 

## Changelog
### 1.0.1
- Removed debug messages (no more Lemon Demon references :( )
### 1.0.0
- First release
