# Pocket Printer
Ever pick up an item and think 'Gee, I sure wish I had two of these'? Then this is the mod for you! Pocket Printer adds 'Adaptive Filament', a new green item with a simple function: When you pick up another item, any filament in your inventory becomes a copy of that item. This works on any item, with red, boss, and lunar items being configurable. Additionally, if you want you can set the filament to be a red item itself!
Picking up two adaptive filaments simply stacks them as you would expect.

Changelog
------------
1.1.0 - Added config options to disable copying red/lunar/boss items, and to set the adaptive filament as a red item itself
1.0.0 - Initial release
