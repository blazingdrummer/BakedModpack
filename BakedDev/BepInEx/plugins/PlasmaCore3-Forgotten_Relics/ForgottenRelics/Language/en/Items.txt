		I saw them creeping in the hills again. At this point I'm not sure weather this damn planet has driven me mad, or if they're actually there. Water's running out. I was hoping these waterways might lead to water, but I've found only tar... \r\n
		\r\n
		...Bad luck, landing in a desert...\r\n
		\r\n
		...I don't have much left in me. The water is running out... \r\n
		\r\n
		Listen. If anyone actually reads this log, please. Save yourself. There is nothing for you here but sand and tar.\r\n
