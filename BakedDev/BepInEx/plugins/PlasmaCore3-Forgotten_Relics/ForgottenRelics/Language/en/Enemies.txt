		Man 1: Do you see it now? A massive tower, over near the cliff? Yeah, so I've been watching it from a distance, and it started to move! I wanted to have a closer look, but those brass contraptions haven't stopped swarming around it, and I don't feel like ending up like Tharson...\r\n

A massive worm, formed of deep stone bursts forth! It's body is made up of large chunks of rocks, and stone rings, all floating around a centeral stone pillar.\r\n
		\r\n
		They seem to be able to temporarily shove the rock in front of them asside as though it were a liquid, to make a path. When they sustain enough damage, they shed the outer layer of rocks, and retreat back into the earth. Unfortunatly, this meaning we've never really had a chance to properly look one over. We're not really sure at the moment what their purpose is. The fact that they abandon their outer shell when damaged, and a brief analasis of the stones they leave behind has lead to the theory that they are some sort of mining equipment, perhaps used to get components for their humanoid brethren?\u201D\r\n
