# Nemesis Spikestrip

Reworks and rebalances to [Spikestrip 2.0](https://thunderstore.io/package/SpikestripModding/Spikestrip2_0/) elites that makes them closer in power to vanilla elites.

Also try: [Nemesis Rising Tides](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Nemesis_Rising_Tides/)

## T1: Plated Elites <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515678914316861451/1131485914137382953/texBuffAffixPlated.png" width="24">
![Elite](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515678914316861451/1131484732497088543/20230720155028_1.png)
- Reworked: Upon damage, increases its stack. only the 6th attack deals damage and resets the stack.
- On death, provides small amounts of armor to enemies around itself. (buff to compensate)
- Stack is visible in health, hopefully makes the effect less frustrating to deal with.

You might want to **disable / "zero out" ZetAspects settings** if this setting is on, as plated elites become absolutely unkillable early game with this combined.

- Debuff duration configurable
- Ability to "break out" faster by not moving (up to 6x, configurable)  

Note: Might still be too close to [Aquamarine](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Nemesis_Rising_Tides/) elites? let me know if you have a better rework idea (3). I think theyre distinct enough though considering veiled / celestine. different tiers too

## T1: Veiled Elites <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515678914316861451/1131485914363859004/texCloakedAffixBuff.png" width="24">
![Elite](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515678914316861451/1131484733382074458/20230720154346_1.png)
- Increased distortion VFX. this hopefully allows keen eyes users to spot invisible enemy.
- Enemy is visible for a short period upon taking damage. this is to encourage focusing down on a revealed enemy.
- [Assassins](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RecoveredAndReformed/) cannot be veiled as they can inherently go invisible.

## T2: Aragonite Elites <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515678914316861451/1131485914850414592/ragingeliteicon.png" width="24">
