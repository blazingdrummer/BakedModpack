# Description
Saves your progress at the start of each stage. You can leave run as soon as the stage started.
Only 1 save file for each profile for a singleplayer. If you die, the save will be deleted.

# Multiplayer support
It's finally here.
Only the host must have this mod for it to work.
For multiplayer support, I added `Load` button to the character selection screen (it will appear in both, multiplayer and singleplayer).
A button will be active if you are host and was found suitable save file (if save file has the same set of players as in the current lobby).

# Installation
- Install dependencies.
- Put `ProperSave` folder into `plugins` folder.

# Known issues
I tried to save all necessary data so that when you load the game would continue as it should have been without saving.

- Minions would respawn at different positions each time you load the same save file. It's not big of an issue, and there is nothing I can do about it.
- I've not tested this mod much with achievements unlocking, but for most, if not all cases, it should be working as intended.
