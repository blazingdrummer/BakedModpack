# Description
Saves your progress at the start of each stage. You can leave run as soon as the stage started.
Only 1 save file for each profile. If you will die, save will be deleted.
Works only for singleplayer.

# Installation
- Install dependencies
- Put `ProperSave` folder into `plugins` folder

# Known issues
I tried to save all necessary data so that when you load the game would continue as it should have been without saving.

- Minions would respawn at different positions each time you load the same save file. It's not big of an issue, and there is nothing I can do about it.
- I not tested mod much with achievements unlocking, but for most, if not all cases, it should be working as intended. 

# Changelog
`1.0.0` - Mod release

`1.0.1` - Fixed crush when mod was installed using mod managers. Saving lunar coins drop chance.
