A Risk of Rain 2 mod.

## What is Ordered Items
Ordered Items is a clientside quality of life mod that organises the order in which items are displayed according to the item's tier and ID/name. This replaces the cluttered and unintuitive system in which items are displayed in the order that they are acquired. The configuration file allows modification of the tier ordering and provides an option to use alphabetic ordering instead of item ID ordering. Since Ordered Items is clientside, you do not have to be the host in multiplayer matches, nor do any other users need to have it installed.
