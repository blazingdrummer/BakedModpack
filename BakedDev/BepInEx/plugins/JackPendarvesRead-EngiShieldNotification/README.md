# EngiShieldNotification

A mod that makes an attempt at notifying the player that the Engineer's bubble shield is about to go down. This gives you a three second warning when shield is about to go down and lets you plan accordingly.

By default the bubble shield makes a sound when it is destroyed. With this mod you will hear this sound in the last 3 seconds of the shield's lifetime.

i.e. The shield lifetime is 15s. You will hear a sound on 12s, 13s, 14s and finally the shield goes down on 15s.

You can set the volume of the notification sound and the time in seconds before shield goes down to start hearing notification sound in the configuration manager.

Note: this is a client-side mod. Only players who have the mod installed will hear the additional sounds. You will be able to hear the sounds of all Engineer bubble shields in your game regardless of whether they have the mod installed.

As usual, do please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, bug fixes and features.

Enjoy,
Thanks
