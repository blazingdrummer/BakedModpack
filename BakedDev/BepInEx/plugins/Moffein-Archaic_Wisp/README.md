Adds the unused Archaic Wisp enemy into the game. They are an alternative to Greater Wisps on certain maps.

They have +20% HP/damage/director cost compared to Greater Wisps, and shoot projectiles that roll on the ground, leaving a trail of fire.

Send me feedback on the balance!

- Replaces Greater Wisps on Sulfur Pools, Abyssal Depths, Sky Meadow, and Gilded Coast.
- Added to the spawnpool on Scorched Acres when looping.

Internal bodyname is MoffeinArchaicWispBody.
