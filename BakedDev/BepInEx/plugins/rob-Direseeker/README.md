## Overview
Replaces the legendary chest in Abyssal Depths with a unique AWU-tier superboss, Direseeker. To summon it, there are several buttons placed around the map. Pressing 4 of these buttons will summon the Direseeker.

Direseeker is a massive Elder Lemurian with devastating fiery attacks. Killing it should be faster than AWU, but the risk is far greater as it's an offensive powerhouse.

The intent is to make Abyssal Depths a more viable stage for multiplayer, providing a red item for each player like AWU does.
