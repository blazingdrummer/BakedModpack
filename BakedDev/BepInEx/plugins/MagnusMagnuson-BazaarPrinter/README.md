# BazaarPrinters

[Host only]

This mod adds 3D Printers to the bazaar, because I guess people keep asking for it.
**If you use BiggerBazaar, make sure to use version 1.7.1 or higher.**



## Features

 - Config to set amount of printers (up to 4) and how likely each tier is.



## Installation

- Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) (if you haven't already)
- Install [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/) (if you haven't already)
- Place the mod in the Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder.

If you want to change the config
- Run the game once after installing the mod and close it out to create a config file
- The config file will be created at Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\config
