# BulletFalloffFix

The main reason for making this was I felt that commando should be more effective at a distance. I found that by just slightly buffing the falloff distance (i.e. you can shoot longer range without losing damage) this fixed everything and I did not need to make any further buffs to commando.

This change is to the default bullet attack falloff so this will not only affect the commando but also any survivor (or enemy!) which uses the default bullet attack.

Start Distance = the distance at which damage starts to fall
End Distance = the distance at which damage reaches a minimum

Enjoy,
Thanks
