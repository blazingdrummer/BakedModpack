## Revised Shield OSP
A simple mod that improves the lategame viability of shields by preventing missing shields from factoring into One Shot Protection. You will maintain your OSP until you have lost 10% of your actual health. Returns to default functionality if you have an item that turns all your health into shields.

Feel free to ping me in the discord if you have any questions/issues @Griff#7708.

## Changelog

- Functionality is disabled when using an item that converts all your health to shields
