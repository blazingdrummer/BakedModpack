This mod aims to make Stone Titans less of an 'environmental hazard' and more of an active threat.
- Titans can now use their lasers on point blank players. (Can be disabled in the config.)
- Laser proc coefficient increased from 0.15 to 0.5. (Can be modified in the config. Set to 1.0 for the true early access launch Blazing Titan experience!)
- Summon Knurl attack animation length (the thing it does at low health that shoots out the lasers) reduced from 9s to 4s.

This mod is server-side and vanilla-compatible.
