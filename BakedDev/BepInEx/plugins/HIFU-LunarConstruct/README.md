# Lunar Construct
Adds a fodder enemy to Commencement that fires slow, decelerating, bouncing projectiles in semi-consistent flurries and teleports to disrupt and confuse you. Take them out quick or dodge well!
This enemy was created to make the moon a bit more interesting for another one of my mods, however it only made sense to release it standalone.
Enjoy this goofy ahh enemy I suppose. It was made without thunderkit >:).
