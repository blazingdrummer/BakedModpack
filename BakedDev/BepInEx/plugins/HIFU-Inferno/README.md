# Inferno
![In-Game Difficulty](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788866573409845250/988460254482280468/unknown.png)
## This difficulty aims to make the game tougher in a fair and learnable way. It requires lots of awareness and skill.<br><br>For comparison's sake, I believe this is the hardest, below that of Armageddon, however you can configure it to be much more difficult, pretty much impossible.<br><br><sub>*It should feel a lot more like the planet doesn't want you here, and is there to obliterate you. You are likely gonna get swarmed.*</sub>

Note: Other mods that change enemies/directors might not be compatible with this difficulty.
