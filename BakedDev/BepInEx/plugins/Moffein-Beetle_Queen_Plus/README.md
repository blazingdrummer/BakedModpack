Buffs Beetle Queens to make them more of an actual threat.
Overall goal of the changes are:
- Improve Acid Spit's area denial/control ability because of how immobile Beetle Queens are.
- Make Beetle Queens summoned minions feel less irrelevant.

If SpeedyBeetles (https://thunderstore.io/package/duckduckgreyduck/SpeedyBeetles/) is installed, its Beetle changes take precedence.
Compatible with Beetle Queen Buff (https://thunderstore.io/package/FMRadio11/Beetle_Queen_Buff/) if you want to roid out your Beetle Queens.
