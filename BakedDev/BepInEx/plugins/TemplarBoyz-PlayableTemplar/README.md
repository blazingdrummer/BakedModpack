## Overview
The Clay Templar is a slow, versatile bruiser with a variety of tools that allow him to handle most threats with ease. His crippling lack of mobility is made up for with extremely strong crowd control, solid sustained damage and good durability.

Minigun, his primary skill, is an extremely powerful source of DPS once ramped up. Using it slows your movement and restricts sprinting, however, you gain bonus armor while using it. This armor is greatly increased while standing still. Due to the high spread and bullet falloff staying mid range is ideal.

Clay Bomb, his secondary, throws  a grenade that detonates and inflicts tar for 4 seconds. This tar slows and can be ignited with certain skills, causing an explosion that deals a portion of the detonating skill's damage. Afterwards enemies will be Scorched for 8 seconds, reducing their armor by 50.

Sidestep, his utility, is a basic dodge that can be used while shooting. Doesn't scale well and is mostly just good for combat.

His special, Bazooka, fires a rocket that deals massive damage in a huge radius and ignites tarred enemies. Important to note that this ignition isn't a fire DoT, but rather an armor reduction on par with Shattering Justice. This is your main tool for detonating tar. Cycling skills properly and using Bazooka to maintain the Scorch debuff on priority targets is key to keeping your damage output up as the Templar. Alternatively you can get tanky and tickle things to death.

## Tips and Tricks
- Bazooka can be aimed at your feet and used to rocket jump with proper timing
- Minigun gives bonus armor and knockback resistance when standing still, making stacking Bustling Fungus an effective strategy to be a tanky boi
- Tar explosions can detonate nearby tarred enemies, causing an explosive chain reaction that can wipe crowds instantly
- Red Whip can be used while firing Minigun

## Known Issues
- Minigun's stationary armor bonus/knockback immunity doesn't work properly for clients in multiplayer
- Railgun and Flamethrower don't ignite tar for clients
