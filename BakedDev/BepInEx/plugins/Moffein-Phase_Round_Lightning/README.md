Who even uses Phase Round?
This mod gives Phase Round a lightning effect that zaps nearby enemies (and any target you direct hit) once for 150% damage with a 0.5 proc coefficient.

Most of the values can be changed in the config.
The config can be modified in /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/config/com.Moffein.PhaseRoundLightning.cfg

Host-based. The mod only works if the host has it, but clients do not need the mod.

## Installation
Place PhaseRoundLightning.dll in /Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins/
