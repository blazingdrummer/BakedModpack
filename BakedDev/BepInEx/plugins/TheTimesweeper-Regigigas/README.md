## Lore Friendly Skin

[![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/978884006785449996/1134046599606177852/image.png)]()

Now includes a custom skin + name that better fits into the Risk of Rain world, for those who don't want to break their immersion but still want to fight this boss!
This does have to be enabled in config, otherwise you get the normal Regigigas experience.


Note: This model was sloppily hacked together with Stone Golem parts, if any artist is interested in making a proper model for him feel free to contact me on Discord under @braindead_ape

## Skills

### Slow Start

For the first 2 minutes after spawning, `attack speed`, `damage` and `movement speed` are halved. `Armor` is doubled during this time.

For the playable version, this is changed to a 10 kill requirement, scaling down with stage count.


### Crush Grip

Grab a nearby enemy and crush them, dealing 50% of their max health, then throw them.


### Earth Power

Stomp with all your might, summoning pillars of flame that deal 600% damage. Inflicts burn.
    
### Revenge (usable below 50% hp)

Freeze up for 8 seconds, gaining 500 armor. At the end, release a massive blast for triple the damage receieved during this time. Radius scales up with damage taken, up to a limit.
