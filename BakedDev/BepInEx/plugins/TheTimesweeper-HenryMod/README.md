# HenryMod
- Adds Henry, a stickman who fights with a combination of sword and gun
- Designed primarily to use as a base for creating your own custom characters, codebase is modular and easy to understand while easily supporting multiple characters and even enemies eventually- in other words, Example Survivor 2
- Has a bunch of alternate skills and unlockable skins

## Tutorial

In-depth character creation tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryTutorial/blob/master/README.md  
This tutorial is fixed to work with the current update, and will be maintained.

## Survivors of the Void Update
Henry is back!  

In the update for SotV some things were cut for now (namely nemry), and some things might be missing or a little off (namely sound and camera stuff). Let me know in the discord link above if you come across any of this.  
Aside from that, gameplay wise he's back up and running.

Also, as a gift from rob:

These skins are outfits and enemies from the game rob's been working on since he left ror2 modding. Enable them in config "Extra Skins".
