# Lost In Transit
Lost in Transit is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adapts content from Risk of Rain 1, intending to balance and redesign varying features in ways that preserve that best original identites while also respecting the balance and gameplay changes made in Risk of Rain 2.

In its current state, the mod is intended to be an adaptation over a pure port - some features may have changed function or identities for varying reasons. This is done to help players less familiar with Risk of Rain 1's content ease into it and keep things simple. 

If you have any issues with the mod, any feedback you'd like to give, any ideas for new content, or would like to follow progress, you can either join the Lost in Transit Discord Server (https://discord.gg/jzxXsQEZ5y) or you can contact me on Discord (swuff★#2224) - shoot me a DM or ping me in a mutual server. The mod is in active development, so expect new features soon. And as a personal note: I'm still fairly new to modding, so expect issues.
