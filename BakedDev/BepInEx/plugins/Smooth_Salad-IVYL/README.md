# Ivy Library
IVYL is a static library for RoR2 modding, built to streamline the repetitive apsects of runtime-based mods.</br>
*IVYL makes use of a BepInEx patcher to implement some features.*

### Content Management
Quickly and safely define items, equipment, artifacts, and more. Optionally associate your mod's content with an expansion.
> See: `ContentPackage`, `ExpansionPackage`

### Asset Management
Load asset bundles directly from your mod plugin, and swap out stubbed shaders with no fuss.
> See: `BaseUnityPlugin.LoadAssetBundle`, `BaseUnityPlugin.LoadAssetBundleAsync`, `StubbedShaderSwapper`

### Project Structure
Use plugin components to organize your project and even generate customizable configuration files.
> See: `PluginComponent` attribute, `BepInConfig` attribute

### Asynchronous Framework
Simple API to load vanilla RoR2 assets synchronously or asynchronously.
> See: `RoR2Asset`, `RoR2AssetGroup`

### Language
Create formatted and easily translatable language files directly within your project.
> See: `LanguageStrings` attribute

### And More!
IVYL is a work-in-progress! Expect improvements over time
