### Install
- Delete old versions. (You never know)
- Unzip the plugin zip.
- Copy all files to the plugins folder in Bepinex(in your game install directory)
- Bonus points if you create a separate folder inside the plugins folder for every mod

### Uninstall
- Delete the files that come with the mod from the plugins folder

## How the item works
- On crit, reduce all cooldowns by 1 second (+ 1 second per stack) multiplied by the proc coef of the attack that crit.
- On crit, take a % of your current hp+shield as damage. The % scales up with how much damage you deal multiplied by stacks, but never will kill you.

## Other changes
- Razor wire no longer can crit.
- Razor wire no longer triggers from damage flagged as Non-Lethal.
- The reason for both these should be pretty obvious.
