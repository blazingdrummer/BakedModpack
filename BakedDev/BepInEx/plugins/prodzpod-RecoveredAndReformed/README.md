# Recovered and Reformed
> ...also known as UncutRebalance 

Adds enemies that were cut during development, and remixes it to be more fitting to the rest of the pack. Also adds a few more family events.

## Cut Enemies
* Adds **Iota Construct**, a boss construct monster.

  * Its main attack is a powerful *laser* that will melt any opponent that stands in its way.
  * It creates a *shield* around itself that protects itself from faraway harm.
  * When it reaches a health threshold, It will *rise up* from the ground for a moment, retreating itself from harm. 
  * [Spikestrip](https://thunderstore.io/package/SpikestripModding/Spikestrip2_0) compat: Beware of the enemies it *summons!* Watch the ground...

* Adds **Assassin**, a basic humanoid monster.

  * Its ability to sneak up on foe is unmatched, to a point where it is *invisible* and *invulnerable* during its charge.
  * The melee attack of the assassin temporarily makes you *frail!* make sure to retreat if you're hit.
  * [AccurateEnemies](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/AccurateEnemies) compat: the enemy is extra accurate with its ranged, *shuriken* hit.

* Ability to spawn Elite variants of Magma Worm, Overloading Worm, Alloy Worship Unit, Aurellionite, Artifact Reliquary and [Direseeker](https://thunderstore.io/package/EnforcerGang/Direseeker/).

## Compatibility
- Make sure to turn off `2b - Family Events > Add extra Family Events` from [LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/) (or this mod's family event settings) as it does the same(ish) thing.

## Credits
* **FORCED_REASSEMBLY** for idea and name(kinda)
* **PlasmaCore3** for [Forgotten Relics](https://thunderstore.io/package/PlasmaCore3/Forgotten_Relics), where Bell Tower's sprite and functionality was used in this mod/icon of this mod.
* **Anreol** for [Released from the Void](https://thunderstore.io/package/Anreol/ReleasedFromTheVoid), where the name for Iota Construct came from. If you want a different flavor of Iota Construct / Assassin that is more closer to how it was intended, check it out.
