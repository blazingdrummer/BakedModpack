This mod aims to make Arrow Rain a desirable skill to take, isntead of being objectively inferior to Ballista.

- DPS increased from 330% -> 420% (the in-game DPS listed on the skill description is wrong)
- Proc Coefficient increased from 0.2 -> 0.7
- Now roots instead of slowing.
- Vertical range doubled.

Server-Side and Vanilla-Compatible. The mod only works if the host has it, but clients do not need the mod.
