Information:
Adds a playable Lunar Chimera (Golem Form) into Risk of Rain 2. 

 - Features two types of fire for its Primary Skill. Fire four swaying rockets with high knockback, or swap to an auto-target rapid fire gun.
 - Secondary has a huge forward range but no range on the sides.
 - Utility is a quick dash that makes Chimera very mobile in fights. Holds two charges by default.
 - Special flies into the air and then quickly decends to deal major damage in the area around you.

Multiplayer:
All players need the mod installed!

-----

Known Bugs:
 - When getting frozen, Chimera's feet fly up. This is a vanilla game bug.
 - Textures are flipped and off-screen in loadout tab.
 - Chimera's Utility causes them to fly into the air when going down slopes, and doesn't do much when going up slopes...

(Please let me know if you find anything else!)

Void Reaver Mod Ver 0.3.0
 - Lunar Chimera has been added! Still has a few bugs but is mostly playable.
 - Originally I was going to make a skin for void reaver but they ended up becoming their own survivor...

Void Reaver Mod Ver 0.3.1
 - Chimera bugfix update!
 - No longer falls through the floor forever after falling out of bounds.
 - Special now has a maximum duration of 10 seconds before reverting back to a default state to prevent any other possible infinite duration bugs.
 - Special no longer scales its jump speed based on attack speed.
 - Updated VFX/mechanics on default primary to fire 4 bullets instead of 2 (like the vanilla enemy). I originally didn't want to do this but it gives you a greater chance at hitting enemies which could have been annoying before. Damage adjusted accordingly!
 - Updated VFX on sprinting primary. rewrote some of the aiming mechanics/projectile homing to deal with moving enemies. Reduced proc coefficient (I think?).
 - Secondary now spawns 3 pillars and increased knock-up. Damage remains the same but will hit larger enemies harder due to the two extra pillars.
 - Special had its damage reduced slightly... Still working on balance of overall abilities so this will probably change again with next update.
 - All abilities now leave sprinting as-is. For example, if you dash while walking, you'll continue walking. If you're sprinting while using your special, you'll continue sprinting.
 - Damage and balance are very unfinished, I mostly wanted to get the mechanics working correctly first. Let me know how you feel about Chimera in the modding discord! And thank you to everyone that sent me bug reports and ideas!

Void Reaver Mod Ver 0.3.2
 - Reworked the primary system. Although I loved the idea of swapping modes with sprinting, it required much more button presses and conflicted with auto-sprint mods. Now if you tap the primary it fires the smaller targetting shards, but if you hold it to the end of the charging animation it fires out the rockets.
 - Adjusted some damage values, still working on balancing so let me know if you don't like anything!
 - Fixed sway on primary's rockets.
 - Reworked the M2 a bit. It didn't feel right as a damage tool due to it's absolutely wild range and could be used to hide behind things and chip away at boss health, so now it's strictly for causing status ailments. Let me know if you hate this change :^)!

Ver 0.0.1
 - Split Void Reaver and Lunar Chimera into two seperate mods!

Ver 0.0.2/0.0.3
 - Skin support/bugfix!
 - 4 new custom skins!
 - More damage balancing.
 - Area of effect of Secondary is wider but has a shorter forward range (visually the same, not sure how to scale down the effect itself!)
 - Primary rockets have a larger blast radius (125%).
 - Added an audio cue to indicate when the primary is ready to fire again.
 - Fixed the uncharged primary's broken animations.

Ver 0.0.4
 - Completely reworked secondary, still very early so functionality might be weird and may have some bugs!
 - Fixed an issue when dashing while charging the primary attack.
 - Special now sends out non-damaging shockwaves a short distance that stun and cripple enemies.

Ver 0.0.5
 - Fixed a skin error that caused issues with all summonable allies (drones, beetle guards, etc)
 - Removed RyanSkinAPI hard dependency. You must download the mod seperately to get the skins to work.
 - Switched old special to secondary with reduced damage/cooldown/range/etc.
 - Switched old secondary to special. Now causes you to hover in the air where you can fire down 4 orbs, one at a time, creating fire pillars on impact. Let me know how you feel about the change in skills! Still trying to work on a fun default moveset for Lunar Chimera...

Ver 0.0.6
 - Fixed for official game update 1.0.1.1

Ver 0.0.7
 - Due to popular request and unpopular balance changes from myself, I've added a config file that lets you change damage scaling and debuff type for each move. Let me know if you'd like to see any other things configurable.

Ver 0.0.8
 - Renamed to "Lunar Golem"/"Lunar Chimera (Golem Form)" to avoid confusion with the growing number of Lunar Chimeras in-game.
 - Swapped over from R2API to EnigmaticThunder!
 - Reduced the shard damage again... (75% -> 50%)

Ver 0.0.9
 - R2API Update

Ver 0.1.0
 - Survivors of the Void update.

Ver 0.1.1
 - Fixed interaction range.

Ver 0.1.2/Ver 0.1.3
 - Fixed visual bugs on loadout tab!
 - Removed unintentional force on special causing enemies to quickly leave the DoT pillar.
 - Adjusted aiming to prevent hitting the floor instead where you're aiming.
 - Changed primary's heavy attack to deal damage over time instead of in a burst. Let me know if this seems too weak/powerful?

Ver 0.1.4
 - Fixed a major camera issue if you didn't have Void Reaver mod installed as well.
