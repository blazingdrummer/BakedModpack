## What is Aetherium?
Aetherium is a variety pack mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adds in a wide range of items, equipment, artifacts, and more!  
  
Most of the item ideas listed were sourced from the ideas channel on the official discord,
and as such the ones that were I will list the person that came up with the idea next to them.

| Icon | Item | Description | Rarity | Original Idea by |
|:-|-|------|-|-|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/VviXZp1.png) | **Feathered Plume** | Gain a temporary `7%` speed boost upon taking damage that stacks `3` times for `5 seconds`. (`+3` stacks and `+0.5` second duration per additional Feathered Plume.) | White | Ajarl |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/KKb5e2t.png) | **Nail Bomb** | Attacks that deal `120%` damage or more release a shrapnel grenade that explodes for `20x30%` of your damage (`+50%` more per stack). Enemies hit that launched a nail bomb are granted `2` second(s) of immunity to the effect. | White | Zeddy |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/G2G9nFY.png) | **Blood Soaked Shield** |  Killing an enemy restores `10%` max shield (`+10%` per stack hyperbolically.) The first of the stack of this item will grant `8%` of your max health as shield on pickup. | Green | Kaboose |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/ip04Lin.png) | **Engineers Toolbelt** | You have a `20%` chance (`+20%` hyperbolically up to a maximum of `100%` chance) to duplicate drones and turrets on purchase. Additionally, you have a `10%` chance (`+10%` hyperbolically up to a maximum of `100%` chance) to revive drones and turrets when they die. | Green | Insane (originally) Me (Modified) |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/YDxIFfn.png) | **Shark Teeth** | `25%` of damage taken (`+25%` per stack hyperbolically) is distributed to you over `5` seconds as `bleed damage.` | Green | FancyFrenc |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/t71HAK0.png) | **Shielding Core** | You gain `15`  (`+10` per stack) armor while `BLUE shields` are active. The first stack of this item will grant `8%` of your max health as shield on pickup. |  Green | NepNep |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/kZhUTL1.png)|  **Blaster Sword** |  At `full health`, most attacks will `fire out a sword beam` that has `200%` of your damage (`+50%` per stack) when it explodes after having impaled an enemy for a short duration. | Red | Bord |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/6zG0MC9.png)| **Inspiring Drone** | Any bots you own gain a `50%` boost to each of its stats based on yours (`+50%` per stack). Some bots `gain more ammo` for their attacks based on the bonus to their attack speed, and have their `ammo replenished twice as fast` per additional Inspiring Drone. Finally, if an inspired bot is too far away from you, it is `teleported to you` after a delay (`40` seconds for Turrets, `30` seconds for Drones). | Red | Kaboose (original) Me (modification) |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/jxxDRyC.png)| **Witches Ring** | Hits that deal `500%` damage or more will trigger `On Kill` effects. Upon success, the target hit is `granted immunity to this effect` for `10` seconds (`-10%` duration per stack, hyperbolically.)| Red | Me |

| Icon | Equipment | Description | Type | Original Idea by |
|:-|-|------|-|-|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/gkVAlPv.png)| **Bell Totem** | On use, spawn an `interactable bell totem` at the chosen position. When activated, trigger a `shockwave` with a radius of `25m` that stuns and sends enemies flying away from it. Additionally, any `On Shrine Use` effects will be activated. `2` second(s) between equipment uses, `1` second(s) between totem activations, and only one totem can be spawned per activator. | Normal | Ragon, modified slightly by me |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/cSjfGdG.png)| **Jar of Reshaping** | On activation, `absorb projectiles` in a `20m` radius for `3` second(s). Upon success, `fire all of the projectiles` out of the jar upon next activation. The damage traits of each projectiles fired from the jar `depends on the bullets you absorbed`. After all the projectiles have been fired from the jar, it will need to cool down. | Normal | Me |

| Icon | Name | Description | Type | Original Idea by |
|:-|-|------|-|-|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/gnAkUFs.png)| **Accursed Potion** | Every `30` seconds (reduced by `25%` per stack) you are `forced` to drink a strange potion, sharing its effects with enemies in a `20m` radius (`+5m` per stack) around you. Max: `8` buffs or debuffs can be applied at any time. |  Lunar Item |  Shadokuro |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/QQY1j4w.png)| **Alien Magnet** | Enemies hit by your attacks will be `pulled towards you`, starting at `6x` force (`+1` force multiplier, up to `10x` total force. The effect is more noticeable on higher health enemies. | Lunar Item | Me |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/nbsYc3F.png)|  **Heart of the Void** | `On death`, cause a void implosion with a radius of `15m` (+`7.5m` per stack) that `revives you` if an enemy is killed by it **BUT** at `30%` health (`+5%` per stack, max `99%`) or lower, all kinds of healing are `converted to damage`. | Lunar Item | Hyperion_21 |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/MxqLea7.png)| **Unstable Design** | Every `30` seconds you are compelled to create a very '**FRIENDLY**' Lunar Chimera, if one of your creations does not already exist. It has a `400%` base damage boost (`+100%` per stack), a `10%` base HP boost (`+10%` per stack), a `300%` base attack speed boost, and finally a `24%` base movement speed boost (`+24%` per stack). This monstrosity can level up from kills. | Lunar Item | SpookyBoogie |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/l7LS7Rl.png)| **Weighted Anklet** | A collection of weights will slow your attack speed by `10%` (to a minimum of `10%` total) and your movement speed by `10%` (to a minimum of `10%` total). If you find a way to remove them, you are granted `0.25` attack speed `flat scaling`, `1` movement speed `flat scaling`, and `5%` damage per removal. Additionally, removing an anklet grants you a stack of `Limiter Release Dodge`. `Dodge` will allow you to dodge one `overlap`, or `blast` attack before depleting. Once all stacks of dodge are depleted, they will need to recharge (`10` seconds for the first stack, `5` seconds per each additional stack) before fully replenishing. | Lunar Item | Me |
|![](https://i.imgur.com/6lw4kWM.png)| **Zenith Accelerator** | Hitting enemies grants you a temporary attack speed buff that increases attack speed by `10%` per buff stack linearly up to `300%` (+`100%` per item stack linearly), but you lose up to `50%` attack speed (+`50%` per item stack exponentially) the closer you are to `0` stacks of the buff. | Lunar Item | Ragon |

| Icon | Artifact | Description | Original Idea by |
|:-|-|------|-|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/FxvUnX6.png)| **Artifact of Leonids** | After every `60` seconds a meteor shower will occur that contains `6` wave(s) of meteors. | Bord |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/u9OFBut.png)| **Artifact of Progression** | Most enemies will evolve into stronger versions of themselves after a duration. | Chen, Me |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/tEYWscl.png)| **Artifact of Regression** | If a monster is in an evolved form, it will split into a group of its lesser form when it dies. | Me |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/GBH0AeB.png)| **Artifact of the Journey** | Most stages will be randomly picked. After a certain amount, a primordial teleporter will be placed. | Tons of People, Bord |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/syskO36.png)| **Artifact of the Nightmare** | Non-boss enemies are granted 1-4 of the Lunar Heresy items when they spawn. | Inspired by Hyperion_21 |  
|![](https://i.imgur.com/WdXKlSZ.png)| **Artifact of the Tyrant** | Any time a route-ending boss spawns they will be given `1` random elite modifier. | Me |

|![](https://i.imgur.com/O6099IP.png)| ![](https://i.imgur.com/yxNqZkb.png)| **Bloody Fealty** | On use, teleport dash up to 10m in the direction you're going and gain slight invulnerability during the dash. Additionally, all of your attacks now cause bleeding. | Sanguine | Ragon, modified slightly by me. |

| Interactable | Description | Idea by |
|:----|----------|--|
| Buff Brazier | A shrine that allows you to purchase flaming orbs containing a buff or a debuff. These orbs are consumed on the activator of the teleporter and spread their effects out into the teleporter event's radius. | Me, Bord, Ragon |

&nbsp; 

## Known Bugs

- Implement Active Dodging for Weighted Anklet.
- Add BetterUI ItemStats module support for all items.
&nbsp;

## Changelog

[0.6.8]
+ Hopoo Games is at fault for this patch version. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! Fixes the Weighted Anklet Limiter Release not having deprecatedTier set, but instead having tier set which causes it to show up in regular item pools.

[0.6.7]
+ Lots of bugfixes to make the mod compatible post-SOTV. Thanks to Bubbet, Time, and everyone else that contributed towards fixing Aetherium up.
+ New Heart of the Void explosion VFX. Sound is coming next update for it.
+ Modified Artifact of the Tyrant to affect all route-ending bosses instead of just Mithrix.

[0.6.6]
+ Fixed NRE in Buff Brazier that happened if you completed a teleporter event with an orb, but didn't have any next teleporter event (woops!).
+ Reduced default duration of Shark Teeth's damage spread to 2 seconds from 5, should synergize better with certain items and not screw up others as much.
+ Restored the missing Heart of the Void cell shader, didn't realize it was missing.
+ Fixed texture artefacts arising from using point sampling and normal compression (to save on mod size), but sadly we're gonna be 50mb or more for the moment.
+ Adjusted some descriptions in this readme to match ingame counterparts.
+ Fixed Jar of Reshaping's new effect on equipment drones. Shouldn't be sideways anymore.

[0.6.5]
+ Buff brazier update! Adds in a new interactable shrine that can appear with a variety of buffs/debuffs that will spread their effects out into the radius of the teleporter event of any map! 
+ Fixes Bell Totem collision problems.
+ Fixes some model scaling problems.
+ Adds in a new Nail Bomb model (with new detonation effects! sfx next update), adds in new models for witches ring, and shielding core as well.
+ Adds a new effect for the jar of reshaping, sound coming next update.
+ Tons of other bugfixes.
+ New mod logo, headers, bits and bobs.

[0.6.4]
+ Adds Bell Totem, an equipment/interactable hybrid that spawns an interactable bell totem that throws enemies back and stuns them. It also triggers any On Shrine Use effects.
+ Adds an Entity State blacklist for Sanguine Elites that prevents the dash from interrupting specific attacks. Currently, it prevents the dash from cancelling Mithrix's item stealing and fist slam.
- Hides Limiter Release item icon. I couldn't figure out an icon for the moment for it, and it has a buff anyway that shows you the count of Limiter Releases you have.


[0.6.3]
+ Adds Sanguine Elites. Elite buff icon was done by FOG, display model done by Ragon. The elite type grants abilities similar to the regular imps, including bleed on hit and a special dash ability. Players get invulnerability during the dash state but have a mandatory cooldown period between uses of the dash. AIs get the ability to chain dash if their enemy is too far away, but if they dash too often in too short of a period they get stunned.
+ Added Zenith Accelerator, a lunar that decreases your attack speed initially but you gain it back and then some with continuous hits. If it's too powerful, I'm going to add another downside. We'll see.
+ Fixed memory leak issue from using the tracer from Mul-T's nail. It doesn't clean up its smoke.
+ Added a temporary visual effect to Jar of Reshaping's opening.

[0.6.2]
+ Adds Artifact of the Journey. When enabled, stages will be chosen randomly. The dream seers in the bazaar will also be randomized. After every 5 (or stages per loop) amount of stages, a Primordial Teleporter will be placed.
+ Fixed Heart of the Void's overlay pulling from the wrong material. You can no longer be thick and veiny after reviving by it.
+ Fixed a rare culture specific issue regarding using "ToLower" to do a dictionary lookup. It's now culture invariant.

[0.6.1]
+ Fixed odd infinicombo Nail Bombing. It can no longer proc from a hit with 0 proc coefficient.
+ Fixed readme.
