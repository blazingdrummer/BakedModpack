# ShowDeathCause
This mod lets you know how your and your friends miserable lives ended. This is based on the original [ShowDeathCause](https://github.com/Storm312/ShowDeathCause) with some improvements.

## Features
The death notice is now accompanied by a message letting everyone know what killed you and how. This fork provides the following improvements over the old version:
- Works with the latest R2API
- Prints the name of the person who died and the damage taken
- Null check moved to proper location

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) and [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/).
2. Copy the included `ShowDeathCause.dll` into the resulting `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins` folder.
3. Launch the game and enjoy! To remove you simply need to delete the `ShowDeathCause.dll` file.

## Changelog
### Version 1.0.2
- Artifacts update!
- Removed enemy skill and capped float value to 2 decimal points
