## Features

### ItemCounters
Customizable ItemCounters. Choose which tiers you want counted, choose which tiers to show.  
Use ItemScore to not just see how many items you have but how good they are.
By default item score is based on tiers, but you can change how much each tier is worth or even set custom values for each item!

### BuffTimers & Tooltips
Buff timers currently only work if you are the host because the timers are not networked in multiplayer.

### Advanced item descriptions
Use the advanced item descriptions from the logbook that show the actual numbers for all the changes. 
Integration with ItemStats in the command and scrapper windows.

### Show Hidden Items

## Configuration

#### StatsDisplay

The StatsDisplay parses the `StatString` in the config file and replaces all the parameters it finds.
The StatsDisplay can also be moved, resized and recolored and formatted ( See: http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/ )  
If you want another parameter added, feel free to suggest it to me (See Help & Feedback)
Here is a list of all valid parameters right now

$exp $level $luck  
$dmg $crit $luckcrit $atkspd  
$hp $maxhp $shield $maxshield $barrier $maxbarrier  
$armor $armordmgreduction $regen  
$movespeed $jumps $maxjumps  
$killcount $multikill $highestmultikill  
$dps $dpscharacter $dpsminions  
$mountainshrines  
$blueportal $goldportal $celestialportal  

#### Sorting

You can enable/disable any part of the mod in the config file.  
The sorting is completely customizable as well. 
The default sorting value is **S134**

**S** means the items are first sorted by the "Scrap" tag and all the scrap is put at the end of the list.  
**1** then sorts it by tier, in descending order, putting higher tier items at the front. 
**3** sorts it by the stack size in descending order, meaning if you have more of an item, it will come first. 
**4** then sorts it by pickup order, meaning items you got first, come first. 

You can customize this in any way you like.

The full options:

0 = Tier Ascending  
1 = Tier Descending  
2 = Stack Size Ascending  
3 = Stack Size Descending  
4 = Pickup Order  
5 = Pickup Order Reversed  
6 = Alphabetical  
7 = Alphabetical Reversed  
8 = Random   
i = ItemIndex  
I = ItemIndex Descending  

Tag Based:  

s = Scrap First  
S = Scrap Last  
d = Damage First  
D = Damage Last  
h = Healing First  
H = Healing Last  
u = Utility First  
U = Utility Last  
o = On Kill Effect First  
O = On Kill Effect Last  
e = Equipment Related First  
E = Equipment Related Last  
p = Sprint Related First  
P = Sprint Related Last

 - Note: If you want something added to the mod feel free to create an issue on GitHub, many features and options for the StatsDisplay were added because they were requested.
