# Bulwark's Haunt
Adds an alternate ending.  
To reach it, find the Crystalline Blade on Sky Meadow and bring it to the Obelisk.  
Note: the ending is not quick and *will* take some time to complete!  
Version 1.0.0 was created in 4 days by TheMysticSword (TheMysticSword#9770 on Discord) for the Halloween Modjam 2022, entirely without the use of Thunderkit as an experiment.
