# Rising Tides
*New threats are on the horizon! Do you have what it takes to turn the tide?*

## New Elites

Watch out for your life... and your pockets!  
**Magnetic** elites will drain your gold if you get too close to them, and drop only a portion of their money on death. Getting hit by one will send you straight down if you're mid-air! 
Meanwhile, **Nocturnal** elites, chasing like a shadow if left unharmed, will blind you on hit.  

And that's not the end of it all - once you enter the first loop of your journey, **Aquamarine, Bismuth, Onyx and Realgar** elites will step in to try to stop you!

## New Enemy
![Two Mother Mushrums](https://files.catbox.moe/rgwgij.png)  
  
An addition to the Mushrum family - the **Mother Mushrum**!  
This enemy periodically emits little spores, dealing damage on contact with players and allies... and healing targets on contact with enemies!  
Despite its stationary behaviour, getting too far away will make the Mother Mushrum burrow into the ground and appear right beside you again!
