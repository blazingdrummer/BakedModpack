## Giant Particle Fix

Fixes poison/burn particles being giant on certain modded characters. Still looks a bit bugged since the particles will be spread out over a large area, but it won't completely block your vision anymore.

Client-Side and Vanilla-Compatible.

## Installation

Drop GiantParticleFix.dll into \BepInEx\plugins\

## Changelog

`1.0.0`

- Release.
