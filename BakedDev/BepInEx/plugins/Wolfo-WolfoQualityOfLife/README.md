## More Ping Icons
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743886063738683413/900120860717883443/unknown.png)\
(not the full list)

A Unique Ping Icon for;  All Chests, All Shrines, All Drones, All Printers, Scrappers, Cauldrons, Primordial Teleporter, Lunar Seers, Rusty Lockboxes, and generic misc Ping Icons for other interactables such as Fans.

The goal was to have less unnecessary ? symbols and misleading Chest symbols, but it sorta spiraled into having one icon for everything.\
Generally if you see a ? now it will be the stages Newt Altar.


## Buff Icons
This mod adds many purely visual Buffs to help communicate things better.

Things like how long an enemy will stay Frozen for, Hopoo Feather jumps, how long until your Shields regenerate, Headstompers cooldown, Equipment durations and more!\
(please use BetterUI to actually see how long buffs remain)

Also recolors some buff icons because they looked the same as others yet had different effects.

## Interactable Improvements
Speeds up using Printers, Scrappers and Shrines.
This should make using them feel a bit snappier without entirely removing the wait and less of a drag especially when you need to use it a lot.

A Cost Hologram for the Cleansing Shrines, Rusty&Void Lockboxes, Lunar Recycler and Broken Rex as they Lacked one.\
It'll make Lockboxes a bit easier to find and remind you how many Lunar Coins you're spending once you stop rerolling.

Since there is no difference between White and Green Printer this mod reverts the Model change for Large and Mili Tech Printers so they're back to their old bulkier model again.

When you open a Rusty Lockbox you will gain a Consumed Rusted Key similar to Used Dio/upcoming Elixir

A Charge/Position Indicator for Void Field Cell events so you can see the charge percentage when active.

Lunar Equipment will be a lighter slightly purple blue\
Boss/Elite Equipment will have a marigold colored outline\
Lunar Coin will have the light blue color used by the Hud for your Coins

Outline color of the sprites will be changed too.

Especially grateful for any network related reports.\

A lot of things are configurable. If you feel something should be configurable yet it isn't you can suggest it to me.

I hope one day this mod will be made partially obsolete as this mod is just most of the suggestions I'd like to see ingame.
