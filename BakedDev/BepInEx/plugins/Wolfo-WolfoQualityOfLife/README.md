If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.

No, i'm not making the mod client side.\
Every player needs this mod installed.

A lot of things are configurable. If you feel something should be configurable yet it isn't you can suggest it to me.

[SimulacrumAdditions](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/SimulacrumAdditions) for a better Simulacrum.

#### Mods to Not use alongside this one
This mod already does what those mods do in a different way so they become kind of redundant.\
There shouldn't be any compatibility issues if you use both but I still don't recommend it.  
[ShowDeathCause](https://thunderstore.io/package/NotTsunami/ShowDeathCause/)   
[HistoryFix](https://thunderstore.io/package/6thmoon/HistoryFix/)
