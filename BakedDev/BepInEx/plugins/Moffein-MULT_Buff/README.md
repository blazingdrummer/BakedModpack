## MUL-T BUFF
Remember when MUL-T was good?
When RoR2 released, proc damage was based purely on a character's base damage, rather than the damage of the hit that procced the item. This meant that characters that could hit rapidly (namely MUL-T and Commando) ended up absolutely dominating. MUL-T got a base damage nerf as a result of being too powerful under this system, lowering it from 12/2.4 to 11/2.2. This made sense at the time because there wasn't any other way to nerf his damage output.
When the Scorched Acres update hit, procs were changed to be calculated based on the damage of the hit, rather than the character's base damage. This was a big buff to most characters, but it absolutely gutted MUL-T whose main damage source comes from low damage attacks. Ever since Scorched Acres MUL-T has been stuck with a pitiful proc coefficient of 0.4 combined with the 60% damage per hit of the Auto Nailgun, on top of lower base damage that makes all aspects of his kit (including equipments) deal about 8% less damage than they should.

This mod aims to buff MUL-T to be on par with the other survivors considering the new proc system from Scorched Acres.
Client-side. Host does not need the mod.

## What this mod changes:
- MUL-T base damage increased from 11/2.2 to 12/2.4 like all the other survivors.
- MUL-T base acceleration increased from 25 to 32. It's still the lowest of all the survivors, but it should make him feel slightly better to strafe and dodge with.

- Auto Nailgun proc coefficient increased from 0.4 to 0.6. This will make the damage output relative to Commando roughly the same as it was pre-Scorched Acres.
- Auto Nailgun spread per shot reduced from 0.2 to 0.12. This will make it a lot more accurate earlygame, though once you start to get attack speed the spread reduction won't really be that much of a factor.
