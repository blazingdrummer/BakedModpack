jump animation takes too long to end
floats too long when jumping
ability descriptions and icons are offset
	descriptions should use %-based values to stay consistent with the rest of the game
m1 should be able to be held down
triggering passive on aerial enemies should have a vertical boundary as well?
	either way, animation looks strange rn
special should show time limit to use special2
causes player name to disappear
	i think this is resolved
