- fixing animation during death to not resemble special
- ImmuneToExecutes = true
- can block special damage w/ teddy
  - rex can too, so this is fine as long as it isn't too abusable
- crit on Reave
  - advised against this due to the high base damage
- targeter for m2
- damage on Reave falls off late game (due to levels slowing down); potential "fixes"/tweaks:
  - could add a set % damage with each level
    - aka the bandit treatment
  - could add a small amount of armor during Reave per level
    - I personally like this, because it gives you a chance to not instantly be bursted
  - could have Reave do less self-damage/level
    - don't love this idea, because it makes teddy less valuable
    - also doesn't really solve the burst problem
