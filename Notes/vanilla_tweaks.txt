queen's gland plus elite equipment summons infinite allies with no cooldown
shrine of chance in the bazaar should guarantee an item?
gold portal's chance to naturally spawn should be slightly lowered?
not allowing progression?
would be nice if networked text on shrine of chance would disappear after shrine has been fully used
elite equipment have no cooldown in singleplayer, but I think they do in multiplayer
