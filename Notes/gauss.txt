thermal sunder should start with 2 charges?
holding thermal sunder with multiple charges has wonky timing, add a delay (maybe 1s?) after casting before allowing another to be started to make the uses more apparent
thermal sunder's particle effects seem to be causing slight frame drops?
thermal sunder's particle effects are too much and could use clearer boundaries
	start with circles on the ground
	inital explosion could be yoinked from gasoline
	sfx when fire goes off could be taken from a number of items
would like to know the proc coefficients on m1 and m2 (including the initial damage and then the AOE)
utility should have a longer cooldown (2-3 seconds) and should consume charge imo
	can currently perma-stun
	cooldown should start after the ability is ended, not when it starts; this will help solve the problem with always having it when you don't use it to stun
	if possible, could give a longer cooldown when used to stun and a shorter cooldown when ended by releasing the button
		this would allow it to be used for mobility with less frustration, but allow balancing of its potential to stun-lock
		would also allow the damage to be increased substantially (40% is laughable) since you are trading the potential movement for a stun and a longer cooldown
	lock camera facing forwards when using? this would make it feel less like a better sprint button and more like a unique ability
	unsure if it should be startable in the air, probably fine if the cooldown issues are resolved since his specialty is horizontal movement
		the ability to cross large gaps using this techinique would be a unique aspect of his kit
redline should lock you in place while starting? this is up for debate
no vertical movement options
	enhance jump height, maybe during redline? or just have headstomper actually be useful on someone for once
	this does make him rely on his speed to navigate the map primarily, which isn't a bad thing at all
sfx during reload would be awesome
	warns the player that it's happening
	also highlights the decreased reload time during Redline
	might be able to yoink Bandit's asset for it
have m1 originate a bit higher, hits terrain when looking over edges
fix gauss's name XD
Akarius continues to be very frustrating to use due to its prioritization of targets in close proximity rather than the target nearest your cursor
	having "target-seeking missiles" that often curve to completely whiff the target you are aiming at feels really bad
	the visual effect is very good
	Huntress' targeting system would work perfectly here imo
		using the exact same targeting logic and tracking but using these visual effects would be ideal, but even just stealing it completely and just tweaking the damage and fire rate values would work as a bandaid fix for now
pretty sure there is a memory leak because longer runs result in fps drops and degrading menu performance and load times
