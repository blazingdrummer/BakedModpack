full reset of the pack (for now)

Notes:
- lunar coin drop rate seems too high currently
  - 40min Monsoon runs are yielding 10+ coins w/ 3 players, more testing required
  - it is worth noting that the players who spent their coins on an initial visit were unable to collect enough coins for a red item in the Bazaar on a return visit
  - blue portals seemed extremely common, often appearing on consecutive stages, even with multiple visits; the concept of a downside in visiting because of decreased spawn rate didn't seem to apply
  - note very heavy recency bias in all of these points; likely won't be making heavy changes until more data is collected
